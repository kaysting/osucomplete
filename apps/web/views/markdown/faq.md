# osu!complete FAQ

Welcome to osu!complete! Below are some common questions we get along with their answers to help you better understand how things work around here. Keep an eye on this page for new answers every so often!

## How can I view my stats here?

Simply [log in with your osu! account](/auth/login) and you'll be immediately sent to your profile.

We'll perform an initial import on your account where we use the "most played" section on your osu! profile to determine what maps we need to check, then check those maps to collect a list of the ones you've passed.

Once this process is complete, your osu!complete profile should be an accurate reflection of your osu! completion.

## What is completion xp (cxp)?

Completion XP (or cxp, stylistically lowercase), is osu!complete's version of a "score". cxp (or its derivation) is used in most major calculations for rank and percentage.

cxp is calculated as the nomod length of all maps you've passed in seconds divided by 10.

This metric aims to give more weight to longer maps, as they account for more of osu!.

## How is completion percentage calculated?

Completion percentage (as seen at the top of your profile and on leaderboards) is calculated by dividing the length of all maps in a category by the length of the maps you've completed, irrespective of the mods you used to pass them. This can also be seen as dividing your cxp by the total available cxp in a category.

## What is rank based on?

Rank is based on cxp (though internally just the length of the maps you've passed).

## Do unavailable maps (due to DMCA, etc.) count?

Yes. All maps with a permanent leaderboard (ranked, approved, loved) count for completion.

Whether or not loved maps and maps converted from osu! standard to other modes are included depends on your category selection, available at the top of leaderboard, profile, and play next pages.

## Do passes with X or Y mods count?

Yes. Any passing score submitted to the osu! servers counts as a clear, regardless of what mods were used. This means you can complete maps using rate change, relax, autopilot, difficulty adjust, and more.

## Why am I missing some of my passes?

While initial import using your most played section is usually accurate, there are some cases where you might be missing passes. Find and click the link on your profile page labeled "help, my stats aren't accurate", read the detailed explanation, and follow the prompt to start a full import.

## How often are my stats updated?

Your stats are updated immediately after you submit a passing score to osu!.

## How is osu!complete able to check everyone's recent scores so frequently?

o!c utilizes a sibling project, [osu-score-cache](https://github.com/kaysting/osu-score-cache), which continuously polls the osu! servers for newly submitted passing scores and broadcasts those new score events over a real-time server. This pipeline allows o!c to save new scores and update completion stats often within a few seconds after scores are submitted.
