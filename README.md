## Features

- **Real-time updates:** New passes and all user stats are updated as soon as they're available (checked every minute).
- **Full support:** osu!complete completely supports all game modes, ranked, loved, and even convert maps.
- **"Play next" section:** Unsure what to play next? Use the "what to play next" card on your profile to find maps similar to your recent passes that you haven't played yet.
- **Modern, osu!-like design:** Built from the ground up with osu! players in mind, the website is designed to be easy on the eyes.
- **Responsive layout:** The webapp is fully responsive, making for an excellent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Running the project yourself

Note that the intent of these instructions is NOT to teach you how to run your own public instance of osu!complete. They are intended to help you set up a functional development environment and make contribution easier.

**Required steps:**

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/download.html)
2. Clone the repo and open it in your terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and open it in a text editor
5. Create an osu! application in [your account settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#oauth)
6. Set the `OSU_CLIENT_ID` and `OSU_CLIENT_SECRET` env variables to the values provided by osu!
7. Set env `WEBSERVER_PORT` to your desired port or leave it blank to use `8080`
8. Populate the database with beatmap data
    1. Run `npm run maintain -- dldump` to download the latest osu! data dump
    2. Run `npm run maintain -- importmaps` to read the dump and fetch map data from the osu! API (this will take a few hours)
9. Start the processes
    - **Recommended:** Install [PM2](https://pm2.io/) with `npm i -g pm2` and then run `pm2 start` to start both the webserver and updater in the background
    - If you choose to forgo PM2, you can start each process using `npm start webserver` or `npm start updater`

**If you need user authentication working:**

Add `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback` as a redirect URI in your osu! application's settings. Replace `localhost:8080` with your hostname/port and ensure it's also set as the `HOSTNAME` env variable.

These instructions aren't fully tested so please [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/fNSnMG7S3C) if you need any help.

## AI Disclosure

This codebase 98% human-written.

Google Gemini has played a significant part in preliminary bug catching and helping to think through complex logic, especially dealing with rare edge cases like convert handling, hybrid mapsets, and import logic.

Any significant AI-generated logic used in this codebase is accompanied by comments attributing it to the AI model that wrote it. Additionally, these snippets are strictly human-reviewed and refactored to work within the overarching codebase.

Suspected vibe-coded contributions to this project will be rejected without question.
